# Financial Misinformation Detection Model Using NLP

This project aims to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can detect misinformation in financial texts. Misinformation in financial content can lead to poor investment decisions and market volatility. This model helps classify financial text as factual or misleading.

## 📅 Project Duration

**August 2024 – March 2025**

## 📌 Objective

To develop a machine learning model using NLP techniques that identifies and flags misleading or false financial information in online content such as news articles, blog posts, and social media.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

With the growing influence of online content on investor behavior, the spread of financial misinformation can have serious economic consequences. This project seeks to minimize such risks by detecting and filtering unreliable content in real time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: 
  - NLP: NLTK, SpaCy, Transformers (Hugging Face)  
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn  
  - Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Model**: BERT / DistilBERT for text classification  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  
- **Version Control**: Git  

## 🗂️ Dataset

- [Insert dataset source here, e.g., Kaggle / custom-scraped dataset]
- Dataset includes labeled financial content categorized as *factual* or *misleading*.

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Collection** – Gathered financial text data from trusted and untrusted sources.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Cleaned text using tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, etc.  
3. **Feature Extraction** – Converted text to embeddings using BERT tokenizer.  
4. **Model Building** – Fine-tuned a transformer-based model for binary classification.  
5. **Evaluation** – Used standard metrics to assess performance.  
6. **Result Analysis** – Visualized and interpreted model predictions.

## 📊 Results

- Accuracy: XX%  
- Precision: XX%  
- Recall: XX%  
- F1-Score: XX%  
(*Replace with actual metrics after model evaluation*)

## 💡 Key Features

- Detects misinformation in financial texts in real-time.  
- Leverages pre-trained language models for high accuracy.  
- Scalable for integration into financial platforms or browser extensions.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Expand dataset with multilingual financial content.  
- Deploy model as an API or browser extension.  
- Improve context understanding using more advanced LLMs (like GPT-based models).
